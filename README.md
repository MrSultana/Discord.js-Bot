# Discord.js-Bot
This is my discord.js bot that I created using this tutorial by codelyon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_qg0Ut9nU8
I will add new commands to the bot as I watch the various videos on codelyon's channel
You are welcome to suggest how I could improve this bot
I use node.js to host the bot on my pc

I use Visual Studio Code IDE to program the bot
